        <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
        <div class = "content">
            GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service.
            
            Simply put, it is a tool that enables collaboration by hosting shared Git repositories that teams of developers can all contribute to.
            
            While GitHub uses Git, the functionality it provides is **VERY** different from Git so make sure you understand that Git and GitHub are not the same thing.
            
            In short, Git is a Version Control System. GitHub is an online platform for hosting and sharing code, text files and even more complex file formats.

        <h2>Why use GitHub?</h2>

        <div class = "content">
            It provides a great way for you to store your code in a remote location
            
            It’s a fantastic way to collaborate with other developers both privately and publicly
            
            Many large open source projects are hosted on GitHub, which makes it very easy to examine the code both on GitHub and locally
            
            In the next couple of chapters, we will learn how to move code from our local repository to a remote repository on GitHub using the ***push*** command
